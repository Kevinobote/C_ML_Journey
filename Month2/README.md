# Month 2: Pointers & Memory Management (Days 31-60)

## Overview
Master pointers and dynamic memory - the most powerful and critical aspects of C programming.

## Week 5: Understanding Pointers
- **Day 31-34**: Pointer basics, declaring/initializing pointers, address-of (&) and dereference (*) operators
- **Day 35-37**: Pointers and arrays, pointer arithmetic

## Week 6: Functions & Pointers
- **Day 38-40**: Pass by reference using pointers, returning pointers from functions
- **Day 41-44**: Pointers to pointers, array of pointers

## Week 7: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **Day 45-47**: malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free() - heap vs. stack memory
- **Day 48-51**: Common pointer errors (dangling pointers, memory leaks, null pointer dereferencing), best practices

## Week 8: Structures & Unions
- **Day 52-55**: Structures, accessing members, pointers to structures
- **Day 56-58**: Nested structures, arrays of structures
- **Day 59-60**: Unions, enums, typedef

## Key Concepts to Master
- Pointer fundamentals and arithmetic
- Dynamic memory management
- Memory safety and debugging
- Advanced data structures
- Efficient memory usage
