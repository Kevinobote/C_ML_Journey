# C_ML_Journey - Day 21: Data Analysis Project

## 📜 Overview

Today marks the end of Week 3 and the start of a new chapter: applying our knowledge to a practical project. This mini-project, `data_analyzer`, combines all the core C concepts we've learned so far, including dynamic memory, structures, file I/O, and robust error handling.

The goal is to build a simple command-line program that performs basic statistical analysis on a dataset stored in a text file.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

* **File I/O (`<stdio.h>`):** The program reads numerical data from an input file and writes the analysis results to an output file.
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation (`<stdlib.h>`):** We use `malloc` and `free` to dynamically create an array to hold the data. This is crucial because the number of data points is unknown until runtime.
* **Structures (`struct` & `typedef`):** A custom `AnalysisResult_t` structure is used to elegantly store the calculated average, minimum, maximum, and count as a single, cohesive unit.
* **Functions:** The program is modular, with separate functions for reading data, performing the analysis, and writing the results. This improves code organization and reusability.
* **Pointers:** Pointers are used extensively, from passing the address of our analysis struct to functions to handling dynamically allocated memory.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** The program takes the input filename as a command-line argument (`argc` and `argv`), making it flexible and easy to use.
* **Error Handling:** Robust checks are in place for file opening failures and memory allocation errors, ensuring the program exits gracefully when something goes wrong.

## 📁 Files

* `data.txt`: The input file containing the numerical data to be analyzed.
* `data_analyzer.c`: The source code for the data analysis program.
* `analysis_report.txt`: The output file generated by the program, containing the analysis results.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

1.  **Compile the source code:**
    ```bash
    gcc data_analyzer.c -o data_analyzer
    ```
2.  **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    ./data_analyzer data.txt
    ```

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **Integration is Key:** Individual C concepts become truly powerful when combined. This project demonstrates how to build a complete application by linking different components together.
* **The Responsibility of `malloc`:** When you allocate memory, you are responsible for freeing it. The `data_analyzer` program correctly calls `free(data_array)` at the end to prevent memory leaks.
* **Modular Design:** Breaking down a larger problem into smaller, manageable functions is a best practice that leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.
* **Command-Line Arguments are Powerful:** Learning to accept arguments from the command line makes your programs more versatile and less dependent on hardcoded values.

This project represents a significant step in your C journey, moving from theoretical understanding to practical application.
